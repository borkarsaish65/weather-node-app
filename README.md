# weather-node-app
This is a Fullstack weather application.
I have used two different API endpoints to find the location and weather condition of the location.
The two API endpoints are provided by Darksky.net and Mapbox.com.
Mapbox is used to find the langitude ,latitude of the place which is searched.
Darksky API takes these coordinates and finds the current temperature are that particular location.
I have successfully deployed the application on heroku.
